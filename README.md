# simple_website

This is part of the odin project, and I'm trying to create a website given a photo of what the final product should look like. 

The idea is to get used to creating and manipulating flex containers as well as getting a feel for creating a modern looking website from the ground up.

There will be no js incorporated as I haven't learnt much about it yet but this will change and I'll probably come back and try to use it on the final product.
